# C# / .NET bindings

The C# rod (`welder::rods::csharp::rod`, language `welder::lang::cs`) targets
.NET over the one interop channel the CLR offers native code: **P/Invoke across a
C ABI**. Unlike CPython or Lua, C# has no in-process "register a class into a
live module" API a shared library could call at load time — so this backend is a
**build-time, text-emitting rod** (like the [LuaCATS stub rod](stubs.md)) that
emits *two coordinated artifacts* from one driver pass:

- **`shim.cpp`** — an `extern "C"` thunk per bound member, compiled into a
  shared library;
- **`Bindings.cs`** — the matching `[LibraryImport]` P/Invoke declarations plus
  idiomatic wrapper classes.

Both are written together per member, keyed by the same C symbol, so the native
and managed sides cannot drift apart. Member selection, overload grouping,
policy/mark resolution and the bindability gate are the *same* generic driver
every other rod uses — only the emission differs.

## The generated surface

```cpp
struct [[=welder::weld(welder::lang::cs)]]
[[=welder::doc("A 2-D integer point.")]]
Point {
    std::int32_t x{0};
    std::int32_t y{0};
    Point() = default;
    Point(std::int32_t x_, std::int32_t y_) : x{x_}, y{y_} {}
    void offset(std::int32_t dx, std::int32_t dy);
    void offset(std::int32_t d);              // an overload
    std::string label() const;
    [[=welder::getter]] std::int32_t depth() const;
    [[=welder::setter]] void depth(std::int32_t d);
};
```

becomes (under the default `dotnet` PascalCase style):

```csharp
using (var p = new Point(3, 4))       // ctor -> native new; IDisposable + SafeHandle
{
    p.X = 10;                         // field -> property
    p.Offset(1, 1);                   // overloads stay natural C# overloads
    p.Offset(2);
    string s = p.Label();             // std::string -> string (UTF-8)
    p.Depth = 9;                      // getter/setter marks -> a C# property
    using var q = p.Clone();          // the copy constructor's C# spelling
}
```

- A welded **class** wraps an opaque native handle held by a per-class
  `SafeHandle` (finalizer-safe: `Dispose()` or GC finalization releases through
  the native destructor, and every P/Invoke that passes the handle is protected
  against premature collection).
- **Fields** become properties; `const` or
  [`mark::no_reassign`](annotations.md) members get-only.
- **Overload groups** map to natural C# overloading — each overload gets its own
  C symbol, so the exact C++ overload is always called (no wire-side overload
  resolution).
- The admitted **copy constructor** becomes `Clone()` (C# has no copy-ctor
  protocol; a `T(other)` overload would collide with one-argument constructors).
- **Enums** mirror as `enum : <underlying>` with per-enumerator `///` docs —
  C# has the per-member doc slot Python lacks.
- **Operators** map to C# operator overloading: arithmetic/bitwise/unary
  become `static operator`s (a free operator with the welded type on either
  side included), `operator[]` a get-only indexer, `operator()` an `Invoke`
  method, and the free ostream inserter `ToString()`. Comparisons respect
  C#'s pairing rules — a partner C++ never declared is synthesized (`!=` from
  `==` by negation, `>` from homogeneous `<` by operand swap), `operator<=>`
  expands to the four relationals (heterogeneous operands get both operand
  orders, mirroring C++'s rewriting), homogeneous `==` brings the null
  protocol plus `Equals`/`GetHashCode` overrides, and a lone heterogeneous
  relational demotes to a named method (`LessThan`, …) rather than emitting
  unpairable C#.
- **Inheritance** maps a welded base chain onto C# base classes. Each wrapper
  level holds its *own* handle — the address of its base subobject, chained
  down through compiled `static_cast` upcast thunks — so a derived instance
  passed as a base parameter always crosses with the correctly-adjusted
  pointer, multiple and virtual inheritance included. C# is single-inheritance,
  so a second welded base surfaces as a non-owning `As<Base>()` view (pinning
  its parent); a non-welded base's members are flattened onto the derived
  wrapper, exactly as on the other rods.
- **Virtuals** are overridable from C# through generated **directors** (the
  SWIG model — no vtable patching): the shim defines a C++ subclass per welded
  virtual type whose overrides call back through `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]`
  function pointers, gated by a per-instance override bitmask computed from the
  dynamic C# type. Wrapper slot methods are `public virtual`; `override` them
  and C++ virtual calls — including from C++ callers holding a base reference —
  dispatch into your C# code. `base.Method()` works; a slot you don't override
  falls through to the C++ base (also during C++ construction); a managed
  exception thrown in an override crosses back to the next C# frame intact
  (code 7). Requires a **virtual destructor** on the type (else it binds
  non-overridably), `AllowUnsafeBlocks` in the consuming project, and
  `[[=welder::bind_flat]]` opts a type or method out, exactly as on the
  Python rods (whose `welder::bind_flat` is the same marker). Unsupported slot shapes (C-variadic, reference/pointer
  class or string returns) are a designed shim-build error naming that escape.
- **Nested member types** register under the outer's binding as real C#
  nested types (`Machine.State`, `Machine.Gauge`), resolving like any other
  member. C# forbids a member and a nested type sharing one name (CS0102) —
  welder diagnoses the collision at generation with a designed `#error` in the
  emitted `Bindings.cs` naming both sides and the `weld_as` escape, so the
  first build fails with welder's message rather than a bare compiler error.
  Bound C# names beginning with an underscore are likewise diagnosed — that
  namespace is reserved for the generated scaffolding (`_h_*`, `_owner`, …);
  an underscore-led C++ member restyles into it (`_leading` → `_Leading`), so
  rename it or `weld_as` a name starting with a letter. Parameter names shed
  their leading underscores instead (`_count` → `count`) — the faithful
  camelCase, and what keeps them clear of the wrappers' generated locals.
- **Namespaces map to real C# namespaces.** The welded root namespace is the
  C# namespace of the generated file, and every nested C++ namespace becomes a
  nested C# namespace — `geo::util::Circle` is `geo.Util.Circle`, and
  `using geo.Util;` works exactly as on a hand-written .NET library. Same-named
  types in different sub-namespaces are distinct types, just as in C++. Free
  **functions and variables** (which C# cannot place at namespace scope) collect
  into one `Global` static class *per namespace* — `geo.Global.Answer`,
  `geo.Util.Global.Dist(a, b)`; add `using static geo.Util.Global;` to call
  them bare.
- **Docs** ride along as full XML doc comments: `[[=welder::doc]]` →
  `<summary>`, parameter docs → `<param>`, `[[=welder::returns]]` →
  `<returns>` — visible in IDE IntelliSense.

## Exceptions cross the boundary

Every thunk carries a trailing `welder_error*` out-parameter. A C++ exception is
caught in the shim's marshalling layer (never unwinding through the C ABI) and
rethrown managed-side, mapped onto the matching BCL type where one exists —
`std::invalid_argument` → `ArgumentException`, `std::out_of_range` →
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, `std::bad_alloc` → `OutOfMemoryException`,
overflow/underflow/range errors → `ArithmeticException` — and anything else as
`WelderNativeException`, always carrying the `what()` text:

```csharp
try { boundary.At(99); }
catch (ArgumentOutOfRangeException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); }
```

### `std::expected` becomes the exception channel

A library that returns `std::expected<T, E>` rather than throwing does **not**
get a result object in C#: .NET's failure channel *is* the exception, and the
wire already carries one. So `std::expected<T, E>` crosses as plain `T`, and the
error branch throws — the whole generator sees a `Result<T>`-returning method as
a `T`-returning one, and only the shim knows the difference.

```cpp
template <class T> using Result = std::expected<T, Fault>;

struct [[=welder::weld]] Crate {
    Result<std::int32_t> checked_weight() const;   // C#: int CheckedWeight()
    Result<void>         validate() const;         // C#: void Validate()
    Result<Crate>        clone_heavier() const;    // C#: Crate CloneHeavier()
};
```

```csharp
int w = crate.CheckedWeight();          // value branch: just the value
try { crate.Validate(); }
catch (WelderNativeException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); }
```

The error type is yours, so welder has to be *told* how to render it. It takes
the first spelling `E` actually offers, most specific first: an ADL
**`to_string(e)`** (the customization point — define one beside your error type
and it wins), a `.what()`, direct string-ness, a `std::formatter`, or an
`operator<<`. A type offering none of these is a designed compile error naming
the fix rather than a silent "operation failed".

`std::expected` in **parameter** position is not marshalled — a fallible value
travelling *into* a call has no managed counterpart; pass the payload instead.

The generated `shim.cpp` is compiled **with reflection enabled** against the
same welded header. Each thunk body is a one-liner delegating into a compiled
marshalling library, parameterized by the *exact member reflection* — re-derived
by a shared lookup (`named_member(^^geo::Point, "offset", 1)`), not respelled:

```cpp
void welder_geo_Point_m_offset_1(void* self, std::int32_t a0, welder_error* err)
{ return wcs::shim::method<^^::geo::Point,
      wcs::named_member(^^::geo::Point, "offset", 1)>(self, err, a0); }
```

Only the C-ABI wire types are text; parameter conversion, the call, exception
catching and return marshalling are ordinary compiled C++ (templates in
`<welder/rods/csharp/shim_support.hpp>`). If the welded header changes after
generation, the lookup fails the *shim build* with a designed diagnostic instead
of silently binding the wrong member.

## Building

```cmake
include(WelderCSharpModule)
welder_csharp_generate_bindings(mymod_csharp
  SOURCES gen.cpp                 # WELDER_CSHARP_MAIN(mymod, "mymod.hpp", "mymod_native")
  LIBRARY mymod_native
  INCLUDE_DIRS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
```

builds a generator, runs it (→ `shim.cpp` + `Bindings.cs`), and compiles the
shim into `libmymod_native.{so,dylib}` / `mymod_native.dll`. Compile the
generated `Bindings.cs` (path in the target's `WELDER_CSHARP_BINDINGS` property)
into any .NET 7+ project with the shared library next to the executable. The
generator TU:

```cpp
#include <welder/rods/csharp/module.hpp>
#include "mymod.hpp"
WELDER_CSHARP_MAIN(mymod, "mymod.hpp", "mymod_native")
```

Both helpers ship with the package — `find_package(welder)` defines them
exactly like FetchContent (the `welder::csharp` generator target is exported).

## Distributing: NuGet

```cmake
welder_csharp_nuget_project(mymod_csharp
  PACKAGE_ID Acme.MyMod
  VERSION 1.0.0)          # TFM defaults to net8.0
```

writes a packable SDK-style csproj around the generated pair;
`dotnet pack Acme.MyMod.csproj -c Release` (after the native build) yields a
standard NuGet package: the managed assembly under `lib/<tfm>/`, the native
library under `runtimes/<rid>/native/` — the layout .NET's runtime probing
resolves automatically, so a consumer just adds the package reference. The RID
is the build platform's; produce a multi-platform package by packing per
platform and merging the `runtimes/` trees, or publish per-RID packages from a
CI matrix. The end-to-end walkthrough is cookbook recipe
[11 — C# / .NET bindings](../cookbook/csharp.md).

## Marshalling rules

| C++ | C ABI wire | C# |
|---|---|---|
| arithmetic scalars | fixed-width (`std::int32_t`, …) | `int` / `byte` / `double` / … |
| `bool` | `bool` | `bool` (`[MarshalAs(U1)]`) |
| `std::string` / `string_view` / `char*` | UTF-8 `const char*` in; malloc'd out (freed via `welder_free`) | `string` |
| `std::filesystem::path` | the same UTF-8 `const char*` (out via `u8string()`) | `string` |
| `std::byte` | `std::uint8_t` | `byte` (so a `vector<byte>` is a `byte[]`) |
| `std::expected<T, E>` | the wire of `T`; the error branch **throws** | `T` — see [below](#stdexpected-becomes-the-exception-channel) |
| `std::span<T>` **parameter** | `welder_seq_wire` over the pinned managed array | `T[]` — **inbound only** |
| welded enum | its underlying type | the mirrored `enum` |
| welded class (param) | opaque `void*` | the wrapper (its `SafeHandle`) |
| welded class (value/`&` return, default or `rv::copy`) | owned `void*` (heap copy — pybind11's `automatic`) | the wrapper, owning |
| welded class (`T*` return, default or `rv::take_ownership`) | adopted `void*` | the wrapper (owning), or `null` |
| welded class return under `rv::reference` / `reference_internal` | the object's address | a non-owning **view** |
| non-const welded-class **field** | the member's address | a live view (writes go through) |
| `std::optional` of a leaf kind | by-value `welder_opt_wire` struct | `T?` |
| `std::vector`/`std::array` of scalars/enums (params/returns) | by-value `welder_seq_wire` (copy; params pin the managed array) | `T[]` |
| `std::vector`/`std::array` of scalars/enums (**non-const field**) | the member's address | a live wrapper — `Add`/indexer write through; `AsSpan()` is a **zero-copy `Span<T>`** over the C++ buffer |
| `std::vector`/`std::array` of **strings** | `welder_seq_wire` over an array of per-element UTF-8 buffers | `string[]` (a copy, in both directions — including as a field) |
| `std::pair` / `std::tuple` of leaf kinds | slot array (`welder_opt_wire[]`) | a `ValueTuple` — `(int, string)` |
| `std::vector` of a welded class | opaque handle | a generated `Vector<Element>` wrapper — **reference semantics**, live element views |
| `std::array<welded, N>` | opaque handle | a generated `Array<Element>x<N>` wrapper — fixed size, live element views |
| a sequence whose element is a **sequence** (`vector<vector<T>>`, `vector<array<T, N>>`) | opaque handle | a generated wrapper whose elements are live views of the INNER sequence's wrapper |
| `std::map` / `std::unordered_map` (leaf key) | opaque handle | a generated `Map`/`UMap` wrapper — reference semantics, `this[K]` live views |
| `std::shared_ptr<welded>` return | `welder_sp_wire` (object + boxed copy) | a view pinned by a `SharedBox` (`T?`) |
| `std::shared_ptr<welded>` param | the object's address | **borrowed** (the callee's aliasing copy does not adopt) |
| `std::unique_ptr<welded>` return | released `void*` | the wrapper, owning (`T?`) |

## Ownership and views

The [`return_policy`](return-policies.md) annotation is honored exactly as on
the Python rods. A **view** wraps the same C++ object without owning it
(`Dispose` releases nothing); under `reference_internal` — and for every
class-typed field — the view also stores its parent in an internal `_owner`
reference, so the parent cannot be garbage-collected (and its C++ object
destroyed) while the view is reachable. Given this C++:

```cpp
struct [[=welder::weld(welder::lang::cs)]] Item {
    std::int32_t x{0};
};

struct [[=welder::weld(welder::lang::cs)]] Holder {
    Item item;  // a class-typed field: binds as a live view

    [[=welder::return_policy(welder::rv::reference_internal)]]
    Item& current() { return item; }
};
```

the C# side sees `Item`/`Holder` wrappers whose class-typed accesses alias the
C++ objects:

```csharp
var holder = new Holder();
var v = holder.Current();  // reference_internal -> a live view of holder.item
v.X = 55;                  // writes the C++ member through the view
holder = null!;
GC.Collect();              // holder stays pinned by v._owner — v stays valid

holder = new Holder();
holder.Item.X = 100;       // the FIELD is a live view too: writes go through
```

A pointer return may be C# `null` (the wrapper type is `T?`); `keep_alive` is
documented-ignored (as on the Lua rods) — the owner-reference mechanism covers
the common case.

Value-family containers cross by **copy** in parameter and return position
(like the Python rods' default `<pybind11/stl.h>` behavior): an `optional`
with a leaf payload maps to `T?`, a scalar/enum `vector`/`array` to `T[]` (an
`std::array` parameter of the wrong length throws `ArgumentException`), and a
`std::pair`/`std::tuple` of leaf kinds to a C# `ValueTuple`
(`std::tuple<int, std::string>` → `(int, string)`, both directions).

A **non-const scalar/enum sequence member** is a live object, so it binds by
reference instead — a generated wrapper (`VectorInt`, `ArrayDoublex3`, …)
whose indexer and `Add`/`Clear` write through to the C++ container, whose
`AsSpan()` hands out a **zero-copy `Span<T>` over the C++ buffer** (C#'s
buffer protocol; valid until a size-changing operation or `Dispose`, exactly
a C++ iterator's rule), and which converts implicitly from `T[]` so
whole-property assignment (`obj.Nums = new[] {1, 2};`) still reads naturally.
A `const` member keeps the `T[]` copy (writing through its span would be
undefined behavior).

A **sequence of strings** (`std::vector<std::string>`,
`std::array<std::string, N>`) crosses as a plain C# `string[]` — a copy in
every position, fields included. There is no live wrapper for it and none is
wanted: `std::string` is not blittable, so there is no C++ buffer a `Span<T>`
could view, and each element crosses as its own UTF-8 buffer inside a pointer
array (`welder_seq_wire`'s `data`). Which side frees is fixed: an outbound
sequence is allocated natively and released by the managed reader, an inbound
one is staged managed-side and released in a `finally` after the call. A
`std::span<std::string>` parameter stays a designed error — a span would have
to *view* that pointer array as `std::string`, which it is not.

Containers of a **welded class** instead
get [reference semantics](containers.md) — welder's opaque-container model,
one generated wrapper per distinct instantiation:

- `std::vector<Item>` → `VectorItem`: `Add` / indexer / `Clear` write through
  to the C++ vector; elements are live views pinned to the wrapper.
- `std::array<Item, N>` → `ArrayItemx<N>`: the same protocol minus the
  size-changing ops (a constant `Count`; indexer get/set only).
- a **nested** sequence — `std::vector<std::vector<std::uint8_t>>`,
  `std::vector<std::array<std::uint8_t, 4>>`, `std::vector<std::vector<Item>>` —
  → `VectorVectorByte`, `VectorArrayBytex4`, `VectorVectorItem`: the same
  protocol, with each element a live view of the *inner* sequence's own
  wrapper. So the inner scalar sequence still hands out its zero-copy
  `AsSpan()`, and a write through it reaches the C++ container:
  `terrain.Layers[0].AsSpan()[2] = 42;`. Nesting is recursive, not a special
  case; only a `std::vector<std::string>` inner is refused (there is no wrapper
  for a string sequence — it is a `string[]` copy).
- `std::map<K, V>` / `std::unordered_map<K, V>` (with a **leaf** key —
  scalar, string or enum — and default comparator/allocator) →
  `Map<K><V>` / `UMap<K><V>`: `Count`, `ContainsKey`, `Remove`, `Clear` and a
  `this[K]` indexer whose get hands out a live view for a welded mapped type
  (a missing key throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`) and whose set
  insert-or-assigns.

**Smart pointers**: a `std::shared_ptr<T>` return crosses as a view of the
object plus a boxed `shared_ptr` copy held by a generated
`<T>SharedBox` SafeHandle — the C++ object cannot die while the C# wrapper is
reachable, whoever else drops their reference; a null `shared_ptr` maps to
`null`. A `shared_ptr` **parameter** is borrowed (the shim hands the callee a
non-owning aliasing copy — the callee can use it for the call's duration but
does not take shared ownership). A `std::unique_ptr<T>` return transfers
ownership to the wrapper outright; a `unique_ptr` **parameter** is a designed
generation-time error — a sink taking ownership from a GC-owned wrapper is
ambiguous, so pass the raw object and let the C++ side copy, or exclude the
member for C#.

A **`std::span`** is the mirror image of `unique_ptr`: inbound only. As a
parameter it is exactly the pinned managed array a scalar/enum sequence already
passes, which is a span's contract — the view is valid for the call. As a
**return or a field** it would hand C# a view of a buffer it neither owns nor can
observe the lifetime of, so it is refused there.

What the [bindability gate](bindability.md) admits but the C# rod cannot
marshal — `std::variant` (C# has no sum type), class-keyed or
custom-comparator maps, nested container-of-container wrappers
(`vector<vector<T>>`, `vector<array<T, N>>`), a `vector<std::string>` (the
pointer-array wire is not emitted yet), an outbound `std::span` — fails
**loudly at generation time** with a designed diagnostic naming the escape
(`mark::exclude(welder::lang::cs)`), never a silently-corrupting `void*`.
